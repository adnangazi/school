## FAQ
#### How are my data managed?
Your data are safe because IFIYT doesn't save or conserve them. On your device and only there your data are taken, immediately transcripted and right then removed. About your YouTube data, they are all saved to your account in YouTube, because IFIYT simply does actions there without having to open YouTube.

#### How do I start Using IFIYT?
All you need to start using IFIYT is having the repository code: follow the small and simple local running process to execute the website. 

#### How can I contribute to IFIYT?
Very glad to see you here, it means you really liked our product. IFIYT is completely free and open source, so just go to the repository, study its documentation and pull a request to contribute, we will be very to collaborate! You can also refer us if you prefer.

#### Just giving it a look...
It is pretty understandable if you don't want to start using IFIYT. We always suggest to give a chance to our product, but if you just want to see how it works, you can do the same: follow the instruction to get started.

#### What to do in case of errors?
Not having a server makes IFIYT resilient to common errors, so the system should always work. But if you receive an error, just try to refresh the website. Also try to check the many error log that the system prints to see what's going wrong. Try to control your computer setup to fill IFIYT requirements are even further steps. Last, feel free to contact us if none of this solutions works: we will be happy to help you!
