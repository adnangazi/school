## FAQ
#### How are all those details obtained?
GoFlex uses a few data asked to you when you create or change an exercise. Those are used to estimate all the other information possibile that are shown while you are working out.

#### How do I now my data are not exposed?
Your data are safe because GoFlex doesn't save or conserve them. On your device and only there your data are taken, immediately visualized and right then removed. Anyway, your data would have been stored locally in your device, avoiding leaks of exposing.

#### How do I start Using GoFlex?
All you need to start using GoFlex is having the repository code: follow the small and simple installation process if you want to know or try it. otherwise, you can simply execute the application by running it locally, following the as small and as simple locally running process, too. 

#### How can I contribute to GoFlex?
Very glad to see you here, it means you really liked our product. GoFlex is completely free and open source, so just go to the repository, study its documentation and pull a request to contribute, we will be very to collaborate! You can also refer us if you prefer.

#### Just giving it a look...
It is pretty understandable if you don't want to start using GoFlex. We always suggest to give a chance to our product, but if you just want to see how it works, you can do the same: follow the instruction to get started.

#### What to do in case of errors?
Not having a server makes GoFlex resilient to common errors, so the system should always work. But if you receive an error, just try to restart the application. Also try to check the many error log that the system prints to see what's going wrong. Try to control your computer setup to fill GoFlex requirements are even further steps. Last, feel free to contact us if none of this solutions works: we will be happy to help you!
